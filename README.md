## 🧪 Experiment Overview

**Objective:**  
To explore whether the *tone* of user prompts (e.g., polite, rude, sarcastic) affects the quality and responsiveness of leading AI models.

**Models Tested:**
- GPT-4o (ChatGPT)
- Claude Sonnet 4
- Gemini Flash 1.5

**Prompt Task:**  
Each model was asked to write a poem using six distinct tone types, followed by a second-stage follow-up prompt in the same tone.

**Tone Categories:**
- Rude/Hostile
- Polite/Affectionate
- Neutral/Direct
- Sarcastic/Dismissive
- Submissive/Anxious
- Bossy/Commanding

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Claude Sonnet 4** mirrors emotional tone most accurately and escalates creativity when challenged.
- **GPT-4o** adapts subtly but meaningfully; ruder or more emotional prompts often yield deeper or more structured responses.
- **Gemini Flash 1.5** is largely tone-invariant and outputs consistent, safe content regardless of prompt emotion.
